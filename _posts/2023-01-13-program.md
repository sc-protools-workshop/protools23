The workshop will be held on Sunday, November 12, 2023, 9:00am-12:30pm, Colorado Convention Center, Room 601, Denver, CO.

### Schedule

* 9:00 - 9:35

    *Invited Talk: Using XDMoD for HPC Performance and Quality-of-Service Analysis*

    Nikolay A. Simakov, SUNY University at Buffalo, Center for Computational Research

    The XDMoD (XD Metrics on Demand) tool provides HPC center personnel and senior leadership with the ability to quickly obtain detailed operational metrics of HPC systems coupled with extensive analytical capability to optimize performance at the system and job level, ensure quality of service and provide accurate data to guide system upgrades and acquisitions. In this presentation, we will start with an overview the XDMoD functionality, followed by a summary of applied research associated with the XDMoD project.
